[{"contents":"This year, CatalystNeuro had the incredible opportunity to be part of the Computational and Systems Neuroscience (Cosyne) 2024 conference, a cornerstone event where the brightest minds in neuroscience converge to explore cutting-edge research and methodologies. Our participation was marked by a fruitful tutorial, engaging discussions, and the invaluable chance to connect with fellow researchers and enthusiasts in the field.\nWorkshop on Data Conversion and Publishing One of the highlights of our participation was the workshop led by myself, along with Ryan Ly from Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. The workshop focused on practical skills essential for the neurophysiology community—specifically, how to convert data to the Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) format and how to publish it on the DANDI archive. This session not only provided hands-on experience but also emphasized the importance of open data and reproducible research in advancing neuroscience.\nThe workshop was well-received, drawing a diverse group of participants eager to learn about NWB and DANDI. Their enthusiasm reaffirmed our commitment to open science and the significant role it plays in fostering collaborative and transparent research.\nNetworking and Outreach at Our Booth Beyond the workshop, CatalystNeuro’s presence was also highlighted by our booth, managed by myself and Alessandra Trapani. Throughout the conference, our booth served as a hub for engaging with attendees, discussing our mission and services, and sharing information about upcoming events and opportunities within CatalystNeuro.\nThe booth allowed us to meet with researchers from various institutions, learn about their work and challenges, and explore potential collaborations. It was inspiring to see so much interest in open data initiatives and how they can propel neurophysiological research forward.\nLooking Forward As we reflect on our experiences at Cosyne 2024, we are more energized than ever to continue our work. The connections made and insights gained have further solidified our resolve to support the neuroscience community through our expertise in research software engineering and our dedication to open data.\nWe extend our heartfelt thanks to everyone who attended our workshop and visited our booth. Your engagement and feedback are crucial to our growth and success. We look forward to seeing you at future events and hope to continue fostering strong partnerships and advancing the frontiers of neuroscience research.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/blog/catalystneuro-at-cosyne-2024/","title":"CatalystNeuro at Cosyne 2024"},{"contents":"At CatalystNeuro, we are passionate about fostering global collaborations that advance the frontiers of neuroscience research and education. Recently, we had the distinct opportunity to contribute to the African Brain Data Science Academy, an initiative under the African Brain Data Network aimed at enhancing data science skills across the continent.\nThe Importance of Global Collaboration in Neuroscience In the field of neuroscience, the challenges are as vast as the opportunities. Advancing our understanding of the brain requires not only sophisticated technology but also unparalleled collaboration across borders. The African Brain Data Science Academy embodies this spirit by bringing together experts and learners to share knowledge and tools essential for cutting-edge research. At CatalystNeuro, we believe that open data and open science are crucial for these collaborative efforts.\nCatalystNeuro’s Role and Contributions Our team at CatalystNeuro played a pivotal role in curriculum development and teaching at the academy. We focused on providing practical, hands-on training in data analysis techniques that are vital for neurophysiological research. Our goal was to empower students with the skills needed to manage, analyze, and share data effectively, adhering to the principles of open science.\nImpacts and Outcomes Teaching at the academy was an enriching experience, not just for the students but for us as educators. Witnessing the enthusiasm and dedication of the students was truly inspiring. One of the most rewarding aspects was seeing the students collaborate on projects that applied their new skills in real-world scenarios, bridging theory with practical application. The immediate impact of the academy was evident in the students\u0026rsquo; ability to engage with complex data sets and contribute to ongoing research projects. Looking forward, these experiences have paved the way for further collaborations. Many students expressed interest in contributing to open-source projects and even starting their initiatives.\nThe African Brain Data Science Academy is just one example of how global collaboration can significantly impact education and research in neuroscience. At CatalystNeuro, we are committed to continuing our support for such initiatives, helping to build a more connected and knowledgeable world.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/blog/bridging-continents-catalystneuro-at-the-african-brain-data-science-academy/","title":"CatalystNeuro at the African Brain Data Science Academy"},{"contents":"Embracing Work and Play at Villa Mas Sant Jordi In the heart of the Costa Brava, just a stone\u0026rsquo;s throw from the bustling city of Barcelona and the serene beaches of the Mediterranean, CatalystNeuro recently found a perfect fusion of work and relaxation at Villa Mas Sant Jordi. Our annual company retreat was not only a chance to bond and brainstorm but also to immerse ourselves in the splendor of Spanish culture and nature.\nA Villa That Feels Like a Dream Villa Mas Sant Jordi, a splendid property. Surrounded by cultivated fields and lush forests, the villa featured a vast lawn with a pool, a soccer field, and multiple playgrounds, ensuring leisure was never far away. The villa itself, recently renovated and decorated in the traditional Catalan style, boasted large vaulted dining rooms, cozy living spaces, and modern amenities like high-speed Wi-Fi.\nA Week of Productive Collaboration and Cultural Immersion Our week at Villa Mas Sant Jordi was planned to balance hard work with enriching activities. Here’s a glimpse of our schedule:\nSunday: We kicked off with a warm welcome and a delicious Paella dinner, setting the tone for a week of collaboration and cultural exploration. Monday: The day was filled with talks, group discussions, and a Spanish barbecue in the evening, allowing us to delve into professional growth while enjoying local flavors. Tuesday: After a morning of productive work sessions, we engaged in a lively soccer game right at the villa—a great way to energize and foster team spirit. Wednesday: Post morning work sessions, we explored the historic city of Girona, walking through its medieval streets and soaking in its rich heritage. Thursday: The day was dedicated to creativity and inspiration, with professional headshots in the morning and a visit to the surreal world of the Dalí Museum in the afternoon. Friday: Our final full day was a mix of work and leisure, culminating in a relaxing lunch near the beach, followed by a beach visit and a scenic hike. Reflecting on Our Retreat As we checked out on Friday, it was clear that our retreat at Villa Mas Sant Jordi had been a monumental success. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t just about the stunning location or the luxurious accommodations; it was about how the environment fostered an atmosphere of open dialogue and creative exchange. The serene settings, the comfortable workspaces, and the plethora of activities provided a perfect backdrop to reflect, connect, and innovate.\nWe\u0026rsquo;re returning to our roles at CatalystNeuro recharged and more connected than ever, carrying with us not just the memories of a delightful retreat but also the seeds of new ideas and projects sparked in those five transformative days.\n1 / 3\r2 / 3\r3 / 3\r\u0026#10094;\r\u0026#10095;\r1 / 3\r2 / 3\r3 / 3\r\u0026times;\r\u0026#10094;\r\u0026#10095;\r","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/blog/catalystneuro-company-retreat-in-barcelona/","title":"CatalystNeuro Company Retreat in Barcelona"}]
