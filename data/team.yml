    bio: Ben Dichter is the founder of CatalystNeuro. He received his Ph.D. in
      Bioengineering from the UC Berkeley – UCSF Joint Program in
      Bioengineering, in Dr. Edward Chang’s lab. There he used
      electrocorticography (ECoG) to study the neural control of speech in
      humans.

    more_bio: Much of this work focused on how we control the pitch of our voice
      when we speak and sing. He is now a data scientist consultant for
      neuroscience labs, focusing on building systems for sharing of data and
      analyses.

    more_bio: His research work has been focused on mathematical modelling of
      biological systems and behaviour, i.e. machine learning and data science
      applied to the life sciences. He is currently expanding my work to cover
      for more general machine learning / data science consultancy and software
      development.
