    bio: Ben Dichter is the founder of CatalystNeuro. He received his Ph.D. in
      Bioengineering from the UC Berkeley – UCSF Joint Program in
      Bioengineering, in Dr. Edward Chang’s lab. There he used
      electrocorticography (ECoG) to study the neural control of speech in
      humans.

    more_bio: His research work has been focused on mathematical modelling of
      biological systems and behaviour, i.e. machine learning and data science
      applied to the life sciences. He is currently expanding my work to cover
      for more general machine learning / data science consultancy and software
      development.

    more_bio: During his PhD at the University of Oslo, he explored the use of
      advanced modeling techniques and engineering solution to improve the
      state-of-the-art methods in extracellular electrophysiology for
      high-density neural probes, from spike sorting to selective electrical
      stimulation. Alessio is the lead architect of the SpikeInterface platform.
      He is currently a Postdoc at ETH and he is working on combining multiple
      recording modalities to build accurate and better validated single neuron
      models.

    more_bio: His thesis focused on inference problems for second-order moments of
      activity in biological neural networks, including spike-time correlations,
      balance regimes, and synaptic structure. In particular, his primary
      interests focus on information processing and flow through biophysical
      neural models, which can eventually allow a thorough understanding of
      high-level cognitive function.

    more_bio: During his Ph.D., he studied in the theoretical and computational
      study of associative neural networks (e.g. Hopfield Network). During his
      studies, he has developed an interest in software practices that assure
      efficient, reproducible, and robust scientific simulations. This, together
      with his love for statistics and data wrangling has led him to move
      forward with a career in data science where he can combine and further
      develop those interests.
