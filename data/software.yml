card_paragraph: CatalystNeuro develops software solutions across the data
  pipeline aimed to help neuroscientists focus on the science and accelerate
  their discovery process immediately. We release and support packages for data
  homogenization, visualization, analysis, and lab-wide records. These libraries
  are developed by a team that focuses specifically on neural data and good
  software practices. Our projects are packaged, documented, and tested for
  robustness and ease of use. Everything we build is released as it is developed
  under a permissive license. We commonly work with labs to customize these
  software solutions to the specific needs of the lab, interfacing our platforms
  with their data formats and analysis packages.

    details:
      - paragraph: Automatically convert neurophysiology data to NWB
      - paragraph: "NeuroConv is a Python package for converting neurophysiology data in
          a variety of proprietary formats to the Neurodata Without Borders
          (NWB) standard.  Features:  Reads data from 40 popular neurophysiology
          data formats and writes to NWB using best practices. Extracts relevant
          metadata from each format. Handles large data volume by reading
          datasets piece-wise. Minimizes the size of the NWB files by
          automatically applying chunking and lossless compression. Supports
          ensembles of multiple data streams, and supports common methods for
          temporal alignment of streams."

    heading: NWB Inspector
    details:
      - paragraph: NWB Inspector is a Python-based package designed to asses the quality
          of Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) files and based on compliance with
          Best Practice. This tool is meant as a companion to the PyNWB
          validator, which checks for strict schema compliance. In contrast,
          this tool attempts to apply some commonsense rules and heuristics to
          find data components of a file that pass validation, but are probably
          incorrect, or suboptimal, or deviate from best practices.
