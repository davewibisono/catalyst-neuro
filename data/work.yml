card_paragraph: OUR CULTURE CatalystNeuro values independence and collaboration.
  Our mission is to develop channels of communication and distribution of
  resources between labs to enable exponential growth and innovation. As a part
  of this team, you will be at the forefront of this effort, shaping the way
  data, analysis, and visualization tools are standardized and shared across the
  international community of systems neuroscientists. We embrace today's culture
  of flexibility and work-life balance, and we are flexible with location and
  time commitment. While we are based in the United States, we pride ourselves
  on pulling the best talent from the international landscape.

  - post: Neuro-Data Scientist
    date: April 14 2024
    type: Remote
    job_number: 1
    work: Part-Time contractor
    summary: Develop a data science infrastructure for neuroscience labs that will
      enable collaboration within and across labs. Work closely between
      researchers and software developers, applying practical and
      well-engineered data solutions to neuro-data problems. Provide our clients
      with working code in MATLAB and python that integrates open source data
      science tools into their workflow and guide the development of these tools
      to address the needs of the labs..
    essential_functions:
      - Understand the specific needs of the clients and determine which tools
        can best meet those needs.
      - Delve into the various data formats, pipelines and analysis of labs, and
        implement a plan to integrate the components into a cohesive system
      - Communicate and iterate regularly with labs to ensure product efficacy
      - Convert lab data to standard formats (e.g. Neurodata Without Borders)
        and develop analysis and visualization tools for those formats
      - Participate in weekly video conference meetings
    requirements:
      - Doctorate or post-graduate experience in neurophysiology. Preferred
        experience in multi-unit electrophysiology or calcium imaging.
      - Expertise in python, git and GitHub. Preference given to candidates with
        C++ or SQL experience.
      - Self-motivated and able to work independently.
      - Ability to communicate with clients and respond efficiently to their
        requests.
      - Ability to see the big picture and prioritize tasks accordingly.
      - Capacity to multitask and meet deadlines.
