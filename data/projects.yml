  - project: SCGB and SCPAB NWB Adoption
    client: Simons Foundation
    dates: 2019-2024
    details: "CatalystNeuro has been working with labs in the Simons Collaboration
      on the Global Brain (SCGB) for 5 years, and the Simons Foundation
      Plasticity and the Aging Brain for 2 years. In this project, we work with
      neurophysiology labs that are supported by these collaborations, helping
      them build custom pipelines to standardize and publish their data, and to
      integrate NWB into the lab's analysis tools. This project has provided the
      opportunity to work with a large number of influential neurophysiology
      research groups from some of the leading research institutes in the United
      States:"

  - project: Neurodata Without Borders Dissemination U24
    client: Oliver Ruebel, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory
    dates: 2000-2025
    details: CatalystNeuro is partnering with Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory
      in a U24 project led by Oliver Ruebel to disseminate Neurodata Without
      Borders to the broader neuroscience community...
  - project: DANDI Archive
    client: Satrajit Ghosh, MIT
    dates: 2019 - 2029
    details: CatalystNeuro is part of a team comprising MIT, Dartmouth, and Kitware
      to build and maintain the DANDI Archive, an archive for neurophysiology
      data that facilitates open data and reuse of data in neurophysiology...
  - project: VAME
    client: UCSF Gladstone
    dates: "2024"
    details: We are working with the Palop Lab at UCSF Gladstone to provide software
      engineering services to VAME. Our goal is to make this software robust
      with proper packaging, documentation, and testing frameworks, and to build
      a no-code app so the software can be run by neuroscientists with less
      programming experience.
  - project: Michael J Fox Aligning Science Across Parkinsons’ (ASAP) NWB Adoption
    client: The Michael J Fox Foundation
    dates: 2023-2025
    details: >-
      The goal of the ASAP program is to facilitate collaboration and build
      resources for labs that study Parkinsons’ disease. CatalystNeuro has been
      working directly with 7 of the labs funded by this initiative to build
      custom open source NWB conversion pipelines to facilitate publication of
      their data on the DANDI Archive.

  - project: SpikeInterface Development
    client: Simons Foundation
    dates: 2021-2024
    details: >-
      SpikeInterface is a tool that enables the creation of state-of-the-art
      spike sorting pipelines. As part of the Simons Collaboration on the Global
      Brain, we have developed features into this platform that allow it to
      continue to meet the needs of electrophysiology research as the volume of
      data continues to grow.


      * Optimize backend for high-volume data management

      * Dockerize popular spike sorters to enable free, cloud-optimized execution

      * Integrate drift correction techniques for correcting probe movement artifacts

      * Evaluate spike sorters using hybrid test recordings and inject data into real recordings
