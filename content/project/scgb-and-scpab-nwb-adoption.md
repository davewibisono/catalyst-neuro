CatalystNeuro has been working with labs in the Simons Collaboration on the Global Brain (SCGB) for 5 years, and the Simons Foundation Plasticity and the Aging Brain for 2 years. In this project, we work with neurophysiology labs that are supported by these collaborations, helping them build custom pipelines to standardize and publish their data, and to integrate NWB into the lab's analysis tools. This project has provided the opportunity to work with a large number of influential neurophysiology research groups from some of the leading research institutes in the United States:
