SpikeInterface is a tool that enables the creation of state-of-the-art spike sorting pipelines. As part of the Simons Collaboration on the Global Brain, we have developed features into this platform that allow it to continue to meet the needs of electrophysiology research as the volume of data continues to grow.

* Optimize backend for high-volume data management
* Dockerize popular spike sorters to enable free, cloud-optimized execution
* Integrate drift correction techniques for correcting probe movement artifacts
* Evaluate spike sorters using hybrid test recordings and inject data into real recordings
