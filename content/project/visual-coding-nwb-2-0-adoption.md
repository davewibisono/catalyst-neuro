We built an open source conversion pipeline, [visual-coding-to-nwb-v2](https://github.com/catalystneuro/visual-coding-to-nwb-v2), to convert the Allen Institute Visual Coding two-photon experiment from NWB 1.0 to NWB 2.0. This has resulted in a 62.5 TB dataset on DANDI, [DANDI:000728](https://dandiarchive.org/dandiset/000728)
