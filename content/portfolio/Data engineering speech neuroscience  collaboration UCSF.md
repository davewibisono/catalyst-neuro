We worked with the labs of Dr. Edward Chang, Dr. Nitin Tandon, and Dr. Mark Richardson to use NWB 2.0 as a foundation for standardizing ECoG data. Through this effort we have restructured internal tools to work with the NWB format, and have publicly released high density ECoG recordings during speech on DANDI here . Through this project, we built:

- ecogVIS, a python GUI for visualizing and annotation of raw voltage traces and standard Chang Lab ECoG preprocessing

- ndx-ecog, the NWB extension for storing the cortical surface of a subject.

- ndx-bipolar-table, an NWB extension for storing bipolar schema.
- dx-hierarchical-behavioral-data, an NWB extension for storing hierarchical behavior like transcriptions of natural speech.
- ndx-survey-data, an NWB extension for survey responses
