We developed ndx-patterend-ogen, an NWB extension for holographic patterned optogenetic stimulation as part of the MouseV1 U19 project. We used this extension in a custom conversion pipeline, mousev1-to-nwb, converting data from their Nature Neuroscience 2024 paper, "The logic of recurrent circuits in the primary visual cortex."
