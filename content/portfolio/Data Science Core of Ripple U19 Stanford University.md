We are leading the data scientist for a collaboration between Ivan Soltesz (lead PI), Gyorgy Buzsaki, Atilla Losonczy, and Mark Schnitzer to elucidate the cellular mechanisms of hippocampal sharp wave ripples using calcium imaging, electrophysiology and large scale simulation. Our role is to help these groups collaborate, sharing data and analyses through the NWB 2.0 standard, and promote standardization in the broader neuroscience community. We worked with the large scale simulation teams across several groups to establish a standard for simulation output as an NWB extension, and a converter from the SONATA format to NWB 2.0 here. With the help of Konstantinos Nasiotis, we built an NWB:N 2.0 reader in Brainstorm and worked with buzcode to read NWB:N 2.0 files. We have also released data collected by the Buzsaki Lab in NWB 2.0 on DANDI here.
