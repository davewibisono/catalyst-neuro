We developed [turner-lab-to-nwb](https://github.com/catalystneuro/turner-lab-to-nwb), an open source NWB conversion pipeline using NeuroConv. The data was of extracellular electrophysiology using a TDT system on non-human primates (NHPs) during a 2-choice reaction time reaching task. The data also included spike sorting using Plexon software and trial events. This data was published as [DANDI:000947/0.240510.2211](https://doi.org/10.48324/dandi.000947/0.240510.2211), which contains 1 TB of neurophysiology data, which at the time of publication is the biggest NHP dataset. We also released [this electronic notebook](https://github.com/dandi/example-notebooks/blob/master/000947/TurnerLab/public_demo/000947_demo.ipynb) to demonstrate how to read and analyze the data directly from the archive. This data is associated with the article  “Neural activity during a simple reaching task in macaques is counter to gating and rebound in basal ganglia–thalamic communication,” published in PLoS Biology, 2020.
