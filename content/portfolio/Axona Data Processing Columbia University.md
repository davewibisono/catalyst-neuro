description: The CatalystNeuro team worked with Dr. Hussaini and his lab to
  utilize a state-of-the-art preprocessing workflow on electrophysiological data
  collected as part of their research on Alzheimer’s Disease. Data was being
  collected from the Axona acquisition system and from Intan. They used
  MountainSort and were interested in comparing these results to other
  cutting-edge spike sorters and accelerating data processing through curation
  using spike train metrics, consensus across sorters, and finally manual
  curation. They wanted the output of this processing system to be capable of
  writing the results in TINT format. We built this system in SpikeInterface, a
  package designed to build modular spike sorting pipelines..
